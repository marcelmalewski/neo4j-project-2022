# Basic API with Neo4j (school project)

## Idea
This project implements a RESTful API that uses **Neo4j** as its primary database.  
It simulates a **library management system**, allowing users to register, log in, browse books, add comments and ratings, and make reservations.  
Librarians can manage books, users, and perform administrative operations.
